    "## What is a Generative Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about generative models, we mainly talk about the following 3 types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A model that allows us to learn about a simulator of data. The simulator generates data of desired characteristics - hence generative\n",
    "2. Models that allow for (conditional) density estimation - learning p(x)\n",
    "3. Any approach for unsupervised learning of data\n",
    "\n",
    "The main characterisitcs of generative models are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Probabilistic models** of data that allow uncertainties to be captured and some form of distributions being manipulated\n",
    "* **Data distribution p(x)** is targeted either directly or indirectly\n",
    "* **High dimensional outputs** as compared to classifiers. A classifier may have 1-dimensional output for binary classifier, 100-dimensional for ImageNet whereas p(x) of generative models can be entire images or entire sequences or entire speech signals, which will typically be of much higher dimension\n",

    "## Types of Generative Models\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be many ways to classify generative models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's one way of classifying generative models according to [5]:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fully observed models** - model that observes data directly without any new unobserved local variables, e.g. undirected graphical models, auto-regressive models, Boltzmann machines ![Fully Observed](images/fullyObservedModels.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Latent variable models** - introduce an unobserved random variable for every observed data point to explain hidden causes ![Latent Variable](images/latentVariableModels.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* **Prescribed models** - Use observer likelihoods (observational data that you have have some form of likelihood function, there is a noise model) and assume observation noise, e.g. directed graphical models with latent variables, where we may say that this model has Gaussian noise and we can use the likelihood function accordingly.\n",
    "\t* **Implicit models** - Likelihood free models. Use the change of variable trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the above model types can be visualized based on whether they are directed or undirected and whether they work with discrete or continuous data. Here are the model space visualizations for fully observed and latent variable models:\n",

    "![Taxonomy](images/generativeModelsTaxonomy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explicit Density Models \n",
    "\n",
    "Models that define an explicit density function p<sub>model</sub>(x;$\\theta$). For these models, maximization of the likelihood is straightforward; we simply plug the model’s definition of the density function into the expression for the likelihood, and follow the gradient uphill. \n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit density models can be of the following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tractable Density Models \n",
    "\n",
    "Models that define an *explicit density function* that is computationally tractable. There are currently two popular approaches to tractable explicit density models: \n",

    "##### Fully Visible Belief Networks (FVBN)\n",
    "\n",
    "FVBNs are models that use the chain rule of probability to decompose a probability distribution over an n-dimensional vector x into a product of one-dimensional probability distributions: $p_{\\text {model }}(\\boldsymbol{x})=\\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{\\text {model }}\\left(x_{i} | x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{i-1}\\right)$. \n",

    "Models with explicit density functions is based on defining continuous, nonlinear transformations between two different spaces. For example, if there is a vector of latent variables z and a continuous, differentiable, invertible transformation g such that g(z) yields a sample from the model in x space, then $p_{x}(\\boldsymbol{x})=p_{z}\\left(g^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{x})\\right)\\left|\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\frac{\\partial g^{-1}(\\boldsymbol{x})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{x}}\\right)\\right|$\n",
    "\t\n",
    "The density p<sub>x</sub> is tractable if the density p<sub>z</sub> is tractable and the determinant of the Jacobian of g<sup>−1</sup> is tractable. In other words, a simple distribution over z combined with a transformation g that warps space in complicated ways can yield a complicated distribution over x, and if g is carefully designed, the density is tractable too.\n",

    "\n",
    "Models that provide an explicit density function but use one that is intractable, requiring the use of approximations to maximize the likelihood.
